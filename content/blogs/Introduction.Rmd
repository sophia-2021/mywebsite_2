## Introduction
My name is Sophia and I grew up in **Germany**. This website was created to introduce myself and showcase some of the work I have done so far. On this page you can find a general introduction. On the other tabs you will be able to find some example analysis and visualizations I have been working on. In case you have any questions, feel free to get in touch over the contact details provided. 

## Education 
As mentioned, I was born and raised in Germany. I attended primary and elementary school in a town close to Frankfurt. In addition, I went to a Gymnasium in that same town.

### High School
During the tenth grade, I decided to take an exchange semester to a boarding school in the US. Little did I know that I would end up liking it so much, that I decided to stay and complete my high school there. After three years of boarding school, I graduated from high school in 2018 and returned to Germany for my university studies. 

### University 

#### Undergraduate studies 
In September 2018 I started by Bachelor of Business Administration studies at the German university [WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management](https://www.whu.edu/en/). Despite the Covid pandemic, I has able to complete an exchange semester in South Korea at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), which was an amazing and formative experience in the fall of 2020. I wrote by Bachelors thesis in the Spring of 2021 and officially graduated in September 2021. 
During my studies, I joined the student initiative Enactus and Sensability - The WHU Impact Summit at WHU. Additionally, I worked as a student research assistant for the Institute of Management & Control and conducted mathematics tutorials for younger semester students. 

#### Graduate studies
For my Masters studies, I decided to move abroad again. I am currently attending the Masters in Analytics and Management program of [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/) and am expecting to graduate in the summer of 2022. 

## Hobbies

### Golf 
When I was younger I played competitive golf and frequently traveled to tournaments on the weekends. I competed for my club and state in different regional and national tournaments. At my high school in the United States I actually joined a golf academy and almost practiced every day. I was able to compete in various different states (e.g. Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina), in different individual tournament series. In addition, I played for the high school team, with which we actually won the State Championship in 2018. 
Now, however, I do not compete in tournaments anymore but rather play with family and friends just for fun. I am however still a member of the women's team of my home club in Germany. 

### Travelling 
Another thing I really like to do is travel and explore. Hiking trips, beach days or city tour, all are always valuable memories and definitely time well spend. 

My favorite trips so far have been: 

* South Africa
* Thailand
* Maldives 
* Ecuador 

Next destinations on my bucket list are: 

* Iceland
* New Zealand
* Italy
