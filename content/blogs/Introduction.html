<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Sophia and I grew up in <strong>Germany</strong>. This website was created to introduce myself and showcase some of the work I have done so far. On this page you can find a general introduction. On the other tabs you will be able to find some example analysis and visualizations I have been working on.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>As mentioned, I was born and raised in Germany. I attended primary and elementary school in a town close to Frankfurt. In addition, I went to a Gymnasium in that same town.</p>
<div id="high-school" class="section level3">
<h3>High School</h3>
<p>During the tenth grade, I decided to take an exchange semester to a boarding school in the US. Little did I know that I would end up liking it so much, that I decided to stay and complete my high school there. After three years of boarding school, I graduated from high school in 2018 and returned to Germany for my university studies.</p>

<h4>Undergraduate studies</h4>
<p>In September 2018 I started by Bachelor of Business Administration studies at the German university <a href="https://www.whu.edu/en/">WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management</a>. Despite the Covid pandemic, I has able to complete an exchange semester in South Korea at <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a>, which was an amazing and formative experience in the fall of 2020. I wrote by Bachelors thesis in the Spring of 2021 and officially graduated in September 2021.
During my studies, I joined the student initiative Enactus and Sensability - The WHU Impact Summit at WHU. Additionally, I worked as a student research assistant for the Institute of Management &amp; Control and conducted mathematics tutorials for younger semester students.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<div id="golf" class="section level3">
<h3>Golf</h3>
<p>When I was younger I played competitive golf and frequently traveled to tournaments on the weekends. I competed for my club and state in different regional and national tournaments. At my high school in the United States I actually joined a golf academy and almost practiced every day. I was able to compete in various different states (e.g. Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina), in different individual tournament series. In addition, I played for the high school team, with which we actually won the State Championship in 2018.
Now, however, I do not compete in tournaments anymore but rather play with family and friends just for fun. I am however still a member of the women’s team of my home club in Germany.</p>

<li>South Africa</li>
<li>Thailand</li>
